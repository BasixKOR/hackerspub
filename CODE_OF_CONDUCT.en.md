# Hackers' Pub Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

### Our Values

Hackers' Pub is dedicated to providing an equal platform for all software
engineers and technology enthusiasts. We believe in:

- Open exchange of technology and knowledge
- Equal voice for all participants
- Community enrichment through diverse perspectives
- Learning and growth through constructive dialogue

### Creating an Inclusive Space

Technology communities have historically been exclusive domains. This has
limited opportunities for diverse talents and perspectives to contribute to
technological advancement. At Hackers' Pub:

- We ensure equal participation regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender
  identity, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, health condition,
  social status, education level, region, or religion.
- We actively welcome and empower participants from historically marginalized
  groups in technology.
- We maintain a safe environment where people of all backgrounds can share their
  views comfortably.

### Standing Against Structural Discrimination

We acknowledge that real-world inequalities manifest in online spaces.
Therefore:

- We recognize and actively oppose all forms of systemic discrimination
  including sexism, racism, and ableism.
- We reject the false neutrality of “treating everyone the same” that ignores
  existing structural inequalities.
- We implement proactive inclusion policies for marginalized groups as essential
  steps toward genuine equality.
- We distinguish between discriminatory speech and speech that confronts
  discrimination.
- We maintain that structural discrimination is never justified and must be
  actively challenged.

### Scope and Application

This Code applies to:

- All website features and functions
- All forms of interaction including posts, comments, and direct messages
- ActivityPub federation activities
- All Hackers' Pub affiliated events, both online and offline

Violations may result in restricted access or permanent suspension, with zero
tolerance for intentional discrimination and hate speech.
